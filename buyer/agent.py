"""The buyer's loop: signer, menu, pin, prepare, check, sign, verify, submit, receipt.

The STEP BODIES are yours (projects 02 and 03); `read_menu` is written as the worked
example. The RUNNER at the bottom is not yours to change: it calls the steps in this
order and checks, after each one, that it left what the next one needs. That is how the
order is enforced. A step that skips ahead, prepares before a pin is on disk, or signs
without a passing check is stopped by the runner, not by good intentions.

Every step reads and writes the `Run`. Nothing is global.
